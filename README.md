## [Live Site Link](https://image-gallery-dnd-by-mezan.netlify.app “Live Site Link”)

### Description

Hello there, this is a simple react image gallery with the draga and drop functionality. There are some dummy images I added and there a user have the access to delete the images, the user can select signle particular image or he can select all images by clicking on the select all images button. If a user wants to reorder the images he can reorder them by dragging the images as he wants and the interesting part is there we have a featured image also which is indicated by a indicator label and the featured image is larger then other images. I have also implemented the all image feature by clicking in the add new image button a user can add a new image but that will be a temporary add. The design is responsive for all the devices. That's all in that project.
